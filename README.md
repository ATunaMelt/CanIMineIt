## Available Scripts

On local, this app will run into CORs issues. To get around it, either use Safari with CORs disabled or use a Cors browser extension.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
